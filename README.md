# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice project — a hands-on collection of code implementations and problem-solving exercises designed to strengthen your understanding of core computer science concepts.  

## 🚀 Overview
This project is built to help learners and developers:
- Master the most commonly used **data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps, etc.)
- Practice solving **algorithmic challenges** (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and more)
- Improve **problem-solving speed** and **coding interview readiness**

## 📘 Project Goals
- Reinforce core DSA knowledge through practical examples  
- Explore **time and space complexity** optimizations  
- Build a reusable reference for future coding challenges  
- Develop clean, well-documented, and efficient code  

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Hash Tables  
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking, Greedy, Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming  
- **Problem-Solving:** LeetCode, HackerRank, and real-world coding interview problems  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **File Type:** `.iml` (IntelliJ project configuration file)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<Next-Gen-Evans>/DSAndAlgorithms.git
